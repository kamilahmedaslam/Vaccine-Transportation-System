# Vaccine-Transportation-System

The logistics sector is an important player in the distribution of the new COVID-19 vaccines. To address the urgency of quickly vaccinating the world population, we developed a database solution to increase distribution efficiency and allow organizations to closely monitor the administration of vaccine doses. Our database system provides users with real time information about the vaccine supply chain: vaccine designers, distribution centers, manufacturers, and recipients. Using this information, users can input queries, add information, and analyze summary statistics surrounding vaccine distribution.
